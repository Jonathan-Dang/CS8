    Features:
        -Not Implemented:
            BreadCrumb Removal
        -Implemented:
            B+ Tree and Iterators, MMAP and MAP Varients with Iterators
        -Partly implemented:
            N/A
    Bugs     :
            BreadCrumb Solution is bugged and will be worked on later
    Reflections:
            I think we should implement a fix_crumb(const T& entry) function
            rather than fix it within, since the crumbs move constantly
